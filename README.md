# Shell Scripts

Hello and welcome to my Shell Scripts repository.

These are some of my more useful shell scripts, all written in Bash.

- **weather**
  - Uses curl or wget to get the CLI-friendly weather from https://wttr.in and is very configurable with CLI options to control output.

View each script's folder for more info.
