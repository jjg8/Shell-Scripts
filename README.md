# Shell Scripts

Hello and welcome to my Shell Scripts repository.

These are some of my more useful shell scripts, and what shell they're written in (e.g. bash, PowerShell)

- **jira-get-filters** — bash
  - Export all of the filters owned by you in Jira Cloud, and format it in a GitHub-style README.md file using markdown syntax.
- **weather** — bash
  - Uses curl or wget to get the CLI-friendly weather from https://wttr.in and is very configurable with CLI options to control output.
- **WinGetEvents** -- PowerShell
  - Filters Windows event logs based on severity (-l), date/interval (-d, -r), excluded event IDs (-x), and outputs results in XML format with a summary. Event exclusions (-x) are passed as a quoted comma-separated list. Date range (-r) must include exactly two dates (from,to) in "yyyy-mm-dd,yyyy-mm-dd" format.
