# Shell Scripts

Hello and welcome to my Shell Scripts repository.

These are some of my more useful shell scripts.  In this folder...

- **WinGetEvents** -- PowerShell
  - Filters Windows event logs based on severity (-l), date/interval (-d, -r), excluded event IDs (-x), and outputs results in XML format with a summary. Event exclusions (-x) are passed as a quoted comma-separated list. Date range (-r) must include exactly two dates (from,to) in "yyyy-mm-dd,yyyy-mm-dd" format.

View the script for more details.
